When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want my work saved safely, we are collaborating on a project, or i am traveling and working remotely

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because I donâ€™t want to push all changes to the online, shared repo at all times.
